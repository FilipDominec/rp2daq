"""
This slightly fancier example receives multiple data blocks from the built in ADC 
(analog-to-digital converter) Raspberry Pi Pico.

It demonstrates how a virtually unlimited amount of data can be acquired, with
the main thread staying responsive. Such asynchronous, callback-based operation is 
generally more flexible and efficient. 

Finally, the ADC record is separated into channels and plotted using numpy and
matplotlib's interactive plot.
